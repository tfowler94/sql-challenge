# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with assembling mulitple CSV files into a SQL database and analyzing employee records from the 1980s and 1990s. 
I developed an ERD using QuickDBD to visually understand the relationship of each table table to one another.
Within pgAdmin 4 (postgres SQL), I developed a database made up of tables created from the CSV files provided, creating primary keys for each table that correctly relate
to the foreign key of other tables.
